Abstract
The technology to produce genetically engineered (GE) plants is celebrating its 30th anniversary
and one of the major achievements has been the development of GE crops. The safety of GE
crops is crucial for their adoption and has been the object of intense research work often
ignored in the public debate. We have reviewed the scientific literature on GE crop safety
during the last 10 years, built a classified and manageable list of scientific papers, and analyzed
the distribution and composition of the published literature. We selected original research
papers, reviews, relevant opinions and reports addressing all the major issues that emerged
in the debate on GE crops, trying to catch the scientific consensus that has matured since GE
plants became widely cultivated worldwide. The scientific research conducted so far has not
detected any significant hazards directly connected with the use of GE crops; however, the
debate is still intense. An improvement in the efficacy of scientific communication could have
a significant impact on the future of agricultural GE. Our collection of scientific records is
available to researchers, communicators and teachers at all levels to help create an informed,
balanced public perception on the important issue of GE use in agriculture.

Introduction
Global food production must face several challenges such as
climate change, population growth, and competition for arable
lands. Healthy foods have to be produced with reduced
environmental impact and with less input from non-renewable
resources. Genetically engineered (GE) crops could be an
important tool in this scenario, but their release into the
environment and their use as food and feed has raised
concerns, especially in the European Union (EU) that has
adopted a more stringent regulatory framework compared to
other countries (Jaffe, 2004).
The safety of GE crops is crucial for their adoption and
has been the object of intense research work. The literature
produced over the years on GE crop safety is large (31 848
records up to 2006; Vain, 2007) and it started to accumulate
even before the introduction of the first GE crop in 1996. The
dilution of research reports with a large number of commentary
papers, their publication in journals with low impact factor and
their multidisciplinary nature have been regarded as negative
factors affecting the visibility of GE crop safety research (Vain,
2007). The EU recognized that the GE crop safety literature is
still often ignored in the public debate even if a specific peerreviewed journal (http://journals.cambridge.org/action/
displayJournal?jid=ebs) and a publicly accessible database
(http://bibliosafety.icgeb.org/) were created with the aim of
improving visibility (European Commission, 2010).
We built a classified and manageable list of scientific papers
on GE crop safety and analyzed the distribution and composition of the literature published from 2002 to October 2012.
The online databases PubMed and ISI Web of Science were
interrogated to retrieve the pertinent scientific records (Table
S1 – Supplementary material). We selected original research
papers, reviews, relevant opinions and reports addressing all
the major issues that emerged in the debate on GE crops. The
1783 scientific records collected are provided in .xls and .ris
file formats accessible through the common worksheet programs or reference manager software (Supplementary materials). They were classified under the scheme given in Table 1,
according to the major issues emerging from the literature.
Beyond a numerical analysis of the literature, we provide a
short explanatory summary of each issue.
General literature (GE gen)
Here we group all the reviews and critical comments offering
a broad view of the issues concerning the release of the GE
crops into the environment and their use as food and feed,
including the regulatory frameworks and risk assessment
procedures.

The weight of the GE gen section, in terms of number
or records, is low in our database (9.3% – 166/1783) compared
to GE env (47.5% – 847/1783) and GE food&feed (43.2% –
770/1783) (Table 1). The literature grouped in GE gen reflects
the difference between the EU and the US regulatory frameworks: the former is based on the evaluation of the process by
which the GE crop is obtained and the application of the
precautionary principle, the latter is based on the evaluation of
the product. The adoption of such different concepts resulted in
the need for new legislation and new authorities in the EU,
whereas in the US new regulations were integrated into the
existing legislation and institutions (Jaffe, 2004).
Other countries have been inspired by these two systems
in developing their own regulatory framework (Ramessar
et al., 2008). As a result, the regulations on the release of GE
crops into the environment and their use as food and feed
are not uniform (Go´mez-Galera et al., 2012; Jaffe, 2004;
McHughen & Smyth, 2008; Ramessar et al., 2008). This lack
of harmonization, and the frequent non-scientific disputes in
the media that are not balanced by an effective communication from the scientific and academic world, greatly contribute to enhance the concerns on GE crops.
The EU funded more than 50 research programs in 2001–
2010, for a total budget of 200 million euros, with the intent
to gain new scientific evidence addressing the public concern
on the safety of GE crops. A summary report of these programs
highlighted that the use of biotechnology and of GE plants per
se does not imply higher risks than classical breeding methods
or production technologies (European Commission, 2010).
Interaction of GE crops with the environment
(GEenv)
Biodiversity
Biodiversity preservation is unanimously considered a priority by the scientific community and society at large. This
topic is predominant in GE env (68.4%) throughout the
decade (Table 1; Figure 1). The literature is highly heterogeneous, since the potential impact of GE crops on biodiversity can be investigated at different levels (crop, farm and
landscape) and different organisms or microorganisms (target
and non-target) can be considered.
The GE crops commercialized so far are herbicide
and/or pest resistant. Glyphosate tolerance obtained by

expressing an Agrobacterium tumefaciens enolpyruvyl shikimate 3-phosphate synthase (EPSPS), and the production
of insecticidal proteins derived from Bacillus thuringiensis
(Bt), are by far the most widespread GE traits.
The literature considering the effects on biodiversity of
non-target species (birds, snakes, non-target arthropods,
soil macro and microfauna) is large and shows little or no
evidence of the negative effects of GE crops (Carpenter, 2011
and references therein; Raven, 2010; Romeis et al., 2013).
Two reviews about pest resistant GE crops published by Lo¨vei
et al. (2005, 2009) reported negative impacts on non-target
arthropods; however, these reports have been criticized
mainly for the statistical methods and the generalizations
between crops expressing Bt proteins (commercialized),
proteinase inhibitors (only a transgenic cotton line SGK321
present in the Chinese market) and lectins (not commercialized) (Gatehouse, 2011; Shelton et al., 2009). Negative
impacts of Bt plants on non-target arthropods and soil
microfauna have not been reported in recent papers (e.g.
de Castro et al., 2012; Devos et al., 2012; Lu et al., 2012;
Verbruggen et al., 2012 Wolfenbarger et al., 2011). Indeed,
the positive impacts have been emphasised.
If we consider the effect of GE crops on the target species,
weeds or pests, a reduction of biodiversity is obviously
expected and necessary for the success of the crop. For
instance, cases of area-wide pest suppression due to the
adoption of Bt crops (where also the non-adopters of GE crops
received beneficial effects), have been reported (Carpenter,
2011 and references therein). This is also the case of the UK
Farm Scale Evaluations (FSE), a series of studies which
highlighted that the adoption of a management system based on
herbicide tolerant GE crops generally resulted in fewer weeds
and weed seeds. These results have been used as proof of the
negative environmental impact of herbicide tolerant crops, but
indeed they demonstrate the effectiveness of such a management system (Carpenter, 2011 and references therein). On the
other hand, higher reductions on biodiversity is generally
expected with non-GE crops and herbicide/insecticide applications, because the chemicals used are often more toxic and
persistent in the environment (Ammann, 2005).
Concerns have been raised about possible outbreak of
resistant populations of target species due to the high selection
pressures produced by the repetitive sowing of GE herbicide
and pest resistant crops. Glyphosate resistant weeds have
been reported (Shaner et al., 2012), as well as Bt resistant
pests (Baxter et al., 2011; Gassman et al., 2011). Glyphosate
tolerance appears more relevant because, while new Bt
proteins are available which can be combined in strategies
of stacking, or pyramiding, to reduce the risks of insect
resistance (Sanahuja et al., 2011), it seems difficult to find
herbicides equivalent to glyphosate in terms of efficacy
and environmental profile; therefore, proper management of
weed control is necessary (Shaner et al., 2012).
Gene flow
In an agricultural context, gene flow can be defined as
the movement of genes, gametes, individuals or groups of
individuals from one population to another, and occurs
both spatially and temporally (Mallory-Smith & Sanchez
Olguin, 2011). For instance, GE crop plants may be capable
of surviving through seed or asexual propagules for years in
the field, or they may be able to fertilize sexually compatible
non-GE plants (non-GE crop or wild relative plants). The
occurrence of gene flow may lead to the spread and persistence of transgenes into the environment or the market.
We have subdivided this topic into three subgroups: gene
flow to wild relatives (Gf – Wild relatives), to other crops
(Gf – Coexistence) or to microorganisms (Gf – Horizontal
gene transfer in the soil). The literature on Gene flow
makes up 31.6% of the GEenv literature and is clearly a ‘‘hot
topic’’ because its share increased considerably after 2006
(Table 1; Figure 1).
Gf – Wild relatives
This topic represents 42.2% of the Gene flow literature
(Table1; Figure 1). For estimating the gene flow to wild
relatives, the knowledge of several factors is necessary: the
reproductive biology of the GE crop, the presence or absence
of sexually compatible wild relatives within the reach of GE
pollen, and the reproductive biology and the fitness of any
hybrid.
The formation of hybrids between GE crops and wild
relatives is possible and documented (Londo et al., 2010;
Mizuguti et al., 2010). Hybrid fitness determines the chance
of transgene introgression, that is, permanent incorporation
into the wild receiving population, which was reported in
some cases (Reichman et al., 2006; Schoenenberger et al.,
2006; Warwick et al., 2008). The risk of introgression should
be evaluated case-by-case, considering the features of the
transgene(s) incorporated into the GE crop.
The presence of spontaneous populations of GE canola
with multiple herbicide resistance genes, probably due to
multiple events of hybridization, has been reported (Schafer
et al., 2011). Zapiola and Mallory-Smith (2012) recently
described a new herbicide tolerant intergeneric hybrid of
transgenic creeping bentgrass. Other cases have been
reviewed (Chandler & Dunwell, 2008). Pest-resistant GE
crops (i.e. Bt crops) may pose more risks than herbicideresistant crops, because the introgression of a pest resistance
transgene may confer fitness advantages to wild plants. Pest
resistant wild plant populations may in turn exert selective
pressure on the pest populations even in the absence of
transgenic crops.
Strategies to mitigate the effect of the transgene(s) in preand post -hybridization phases have been proposed (e.g. male
sterility, delayed flowering, genes that reduce fitness).
However, none of them can be considered completely
effective for transgene containment and complete segregation
of GE crops is not possible. In any case, there is no evidence
of negative effects of transgene introgression so far (Kwit
et al., 2011).
It should be kept in mind that the gene flow between
cultivated and wild species and its impact on biodiversity is
an issue that exists independently of GE crops. The literature
is rich in examples of natural invasive hybrids, disappearance
of local genotypes (genetic swamping) and resistance to
herbicides appearing in wild populations due to natural
mutation (Kwit et al., 2011).

Gf – Coexistence
Gene flow from a GE to a non-GE crop can lead to an
unwanted presence of the transgene in non-GE products.
This issue involves not only the movement of pollen, but also
the seeds that could remain in the field and give rise to
volunteers, and the mechanical admixture of materials
occurring during harvest, transportation and storage. The
establishment of populations becoming partially wild (ferals)
functioning as a natural reservoir of the transgene must also
be considered, as well as the survival chances of the GE crops
in the wild.
The coexistence issue goes beyond the matter of gene
flow and involves several social and economic aspects, such
as the manageability of complex agricultural scenarios
where different agricultural systems (organic, conventional
and biotech) coexist and a full traceability system is in force.
The collected records on coexistence account for 35.8%
of the Gene flow literature and their number increased
significantly after 2006 (Table 1; Figure 1). Even in the US,
the coexistence issue is becoming actively discussed (http://
www.gmo-compass.org/eng/news/548.docu.html).
Strategies of coexistence have been investigated for several
species, such as maize (Devos et al., 2008; Langhof et al.,
2010; Ru¨hl et al., 2011), canola (Colbach, 2008; Gruber et al.,
2005), soybean (Gryson et al., 2009), flax (Jhala et al., 2011),
wheat (Foetzki et al., 2012), potato, cotton and sugar beet
(European Commission, 2006). Maize has been the most
intensively studied crop, followed by canola and wheat.
Isolation distances, harvesting and post-harvesting practices
have been proposed in order to avoid unwanted mixing of GE
and non-GE-crop.
The feasibility of a coexistence plan is not only evaluated
from a scientific point of view but also considering the extra
economic costs due to the containment practices; such
extra costs must find compensation in extra income from
GE crops (Demont & Devos, 2008). In the EU, the scenario
on coexistence is very poor currently, considering that
only three GE crops are authorized for cultivation
(MON 810 and T25 maize and ‘‘Amflora’’ potato), with
only MON810 actually commercialized, and Spain accounting for 87% of the entire cultivated surface with GE crops
(James, 2011).
Gf – Horizontal gene transfer in soil
Soil microorganisms may uptake the transgene(s) present
into the GE crop. In fact, bacteria are naturally capable of
acquiring genetic material from other organisms through
horizontal gene transfer (HGT). To obtain a GE plant it can be
necessary to introduce a gene that makes it possible to select
the transgenic cells in tissue culture, by giving them an
advantage over the non-transgenic cells. This is frequently
achieved with bacterial antibiotic resistance genes that play
the role of selectable marker genes (SMGs, recently reviewed
by Rosellini, 2012). SMG presence in GE crops is not
necessary in the field, and it has raised concerns about the
spread of antibiotic resistance genes into the environment and
their consumption as food or feed (see below).
The transfer of these genes to bacteria and the possible outbreak of ‘‘super pathogenic bacteria’’ resistant to antibiotics
has been a matter of detailed investigation by the scientific
community. The number of publications on this topic
accounts for 22% of the Gene flow literature, with a stable
presence in recent years (Table 1; Figure 1).
The results obtained so far clearly indicate that soil
bacteria can uptake exogenous DNA at very low frequency
(10!4 to 10!8
) in laboratory experiments (Ceccherini et al.,
2003; de Vries et al., 2003), whereas experiments in the field
did not show any evidence of HGT (Badosa et al., 2004;
Demane`che et al., 2008, 2011; Ma et al., 2011). Moreover,
in the unlikely event that soil bacteria acquired the resistance
to an antibiotic among those currently used in the laboratory
to select GE plants, this would not affect the population
of natural antibiotic resistant bacteria already present in the
soil (D’Costa, 2006; Forsberg et al., 2012) or imply any
additional risk for human and animal health.
The substitution of antibiotic SMGs with plant-derived
genes (Rosellini, 2011, 2012), their elimination (Ferradini
et al., 2011 and references therein) and in general the
elimination of any unwanted DNA sequence in the final GE
crop is recommended (EFSA, 2011), as proposed with new
approaches to plant genetic engineering such as the so-called
intragenic (Nielsen, 2003; Rommens, 2004) or cisgenic
(Jacobsen & Schouten, 2007) techniques.
Interaction of GE crops with humans and animals
(GE food&feed)
Substantial equivalence
One of the crucial aspects of the risk assessment procedure
for a GE crop is to verify if the insertion and/or the expression
of the transgene produces alterations in the host organism.
The concept of substantial equivalence implies that the GE
crop be compared with an isogenic counterpart, that is, the
same genotype without the transgene(s).
The demonstration of substantial equivalence is a two-step
procedure. First, the GE crop is assessed for agronomic,
morphological and chemical characteristics, such as macroand micro-nutrients, anti-nutrients and toxic molecules.
The results of this analysis will provide information on the
necessity for further analysis of the nutritive value. Any
difference which falls within the range of the normal
variability for the crop is considered safe (Colquhoun et al.,
2006; EFSA, 2011). This methodology has been agreed
internationally (Codex, FAO, OECD, WHO) and involves the
quantification of selected molecules, in a so-called ‘‘targeted
approach’’ (Kok & Kuiper, 2003). If compositional differences are detected, then they have to be assessed with respect
to their safety (Ramessar et al., 2007; EFSA, 2011).
The principle of substantial equivalence has been used for
risk assessment of the GE crops commercialized so far
(Kier & Petrick, 2008; Ko¨nig et al., 2004) and the results
support the fact that these crops are equivalent to their nontransgenic counterparts (Parrot et al., 2010).
Concerns have been expressed about the efficacy of
the method for detecting unintended effects. Field comparisons in multiple locations have been recommended in order
to minimize the differences due to the environmental effects
and large data collections have been created (www.
cropcomposition.org).

It is noteworthy that substantial equivalence represents an
important common ground of the process-based and productbased regulatory frameworks. This clearly indicates a large
consensus amongst scientists worldwide on GE crop evaluation (Kok et al., 2008). Substantial equivalence accounts for
6% of the scientific records collected in GE food&feed
(Table 1; Figure 2). The literature is composed mainly by the
publications produced by the companies that developed the
GM cultivars, as part of the authorization process for
commercialization. Public availability of the data on which
these studies are based should be guaranteed.
Nontargeted approaches to equivalence assessment
The targeted approach to substantial equivalence assessment
has an obvious limitation in the number of compounds
that are analyzed. On the contrary, the so-called ‘‘–omic’’
approaches (transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics) can
analyze a larger number of molecules (Kier & Petrick, 2008).
Several GE crops were compared to their isogenic counterparts using –omic approaches and in some cases differences
were observed. However, the interpretation of these results is
difficult due to the non-homogeneity of the experimental
designs. Moreover, the differences emerging from the –omic
analyses have to be cleaned up from the environmental
effects and their biological relevance weighted in terms
of food and feed safety (Ricroch et al., 2011 and references
therein).
It appears that the application of the –omics methods as
standard procedure in the risk assessment of GE crop does not
actually provide manageable information, and needs further
development and validation. In this scenario, the substantial
equivalence concept remains a robust and safe reference to
determine the presence of unintended effects (European
Commission, 2010). The weight of the nontargeted assessment topic increased significantly over the years, especially in
2009–2011 leading to a significant number of publications
(13.9%) (Table 1; Figure 2).
GE food/feed consumption
The scientific records grouped under this topic are numerous
and constitute 40.5% of the GE food&feed literature, clearly
indicating the importance of the human health issues. The
distribution over the year is uniform, but a peak was observed
in 2008, probably due to the scientific fervors that followed
the publication of experimental studies conducted by the
private companies after 2006 (Table 1; Figure 2). According
to the literature, the concerns about GE food/feed consumption that emerge from the scientific and social debates can be
summarized as follows: safety of the inserted transgenic DNA
and the transcribed RNA, safety of the protein(s) encoded by
the transgene(s) and safety of the intended and unintended
change of crop composition (Dona & Arvanitoyannis, 2009;
Parrot et al., 2010).
Safety of the inserted transgenic DNA and the transcribed
RNA
DNA. It is estimated that, with a normal diet, humans
consume between 0.1 and 1 g of DNA/day from different
sources (e.g. meat, vegetables) (Parrot et al., 2010).
This DNA is partly digested, but it can also stimulate
the immune-system or promote bacterial biofilm formation
(Rizzi et al., 2012). The DNA sequences that drive the
expression of the transgenes in the plant cell are generally
derived from viruses or bacteria. Concerns have been
expressed on the possibility that the transgenic DNA may
resist the digestion process, leading to HGT to bacteria
living in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, or translocation
and accumulation into the human body and food products
from livestock animals. Some considerations can help to put
this issue in context:
(a) transgenic DNA is enormously diluted by the total
amount of ingested DNA (from 0.00006% to 0.00009%)
and is digested like any other DNA (Parrot et al., 2010).
In addition, food processing (e.g. baking, frying, boiling)

usually results in DNA degradation (Gryson, 2010; Rizzi
et al., 2012) further reducing the amount of intact DNA;
(b) HGT of transgenic DNA to GI bacteria of human and
animals is estimated to be an extremely rare event, as
confirmed by all the experiments conducted so far
(Rizzi et al., 2012). In the unlikely case that this event
occurs, the worst scenario is characterized by the HGT
of antibiotic resistance genes to GI bacteria, making
them resistant to clinical therapies. However, the antibiotic resistance genes found into GE crops today do not
present any significant risk to human or animal health
(Ramessar et al., 2007), and they are already naturally
present into the environment and/or the human/animal
GI (EFSA, 2011; Wilcks & Jacobsen, 2010).
(c) DNA fragments can be transferred across the GI barrier.
This natural phenomenon has been demonstrated only
for high-copy-number genes that have been detected in
internal organs, tissues and blood of different animals and
even in cow milk (Parrot et al., 2010; Rizzi et al., 2012;
van de Eede et al., 2004 and references therein).
In humans, the transfer through the GI tract of a highcopy-number gene from rabbit meat has been reported
(Forsman et al., 2003).
(d) Transgenic DNA transfer through the GI tract has
been reported in the literature in pig, lamb and rainbow
trout (Chainark et al., 2006, 2008; Mazza et al., 2005;
Sharma et al., 2006;), but in micro quantities and in
the case of pigs and lambs with questionable reproducibility due to possible cross contamination (Walsh et al.,
2011).
(e) In most studies conducted so far, no fragments of
transgenic DNA were detected in any animal-derived
products (ILSI, 2008). Only in one case, the presence of
transgenic DNA in both ‘‘organic’’ and ‘‘conventional’’
cattle milk has been reported (Agodi et al., 2006).
(f) No evidence has been obtained to date that DNA
absorbed through the GI tract can be integrated into the
cells of the host organism and lead to a germ line transfer.
It can be concluded that transgenic DNA does not differ
intrinsically or physically from any other DNA already
present in foods and that the ingestion of transgenic DNA
does not imply higher risks than ingestion of any other type
of DNA (European Commission, 2010).
RNA. Along with the DNA also the corresponding transcribed RNAs are ingested and in general the content of DNA
and RNA in foods are roughly comparable (Parrot et al.,
2010). In the light of recent scientific evidence (Zhang et al.,
2012a discussed below) concerns have been expressed about
the potential effects that certain types of RNA (small doublestrand RNAs, dsRNAs) introduced in some GE crops
(e.g. virus resistant, altered oil composition) could have on
human/animal health.
The function of such dsRNAs is not to be translated into
proteins but to mediate gene regulation through a mechanism
termed RNA interference (RNAi). The general mechanism
of RNAi is conserved across eukaryotes and is triggered
by different types of dsRNAs including small interfering
RNA (siRNAs) and microRNAs (miRNAs) (Melnyk et al.,
2011).
Recently, Zhang et al., (2012a) reported the first evidence
of transfer, through the mouse GI tract, of a food-derived
exogenous miRNA (MIR168a) naturally abundant in rice
and previously detected also in human blood. This study
highlights the unexpected resistance of the rice MIR168a to
heat treatment during cooking and to digestion during
the transit through the GI tract in the mouse. Moreover,
the authors showed significant activity of the MIR168a on the
RNAi-mediated regulation of a protein involved in the
removal of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) in liver cells
(Zhang et al., 2012a). This evidence is still the object
of debate at the scientific level and a summary of the major
issues are reported here:
(a) miRNAs are naturally present in both animal and
plant derived foods/feeds and with a reported similarity
to human genes (Ivashuta et al., 2009; Petrick et al.,
2013);
(b) Petrick et al. (2013) pointed out that previous studies
on feeding rats with rice (Zhou et al., 2011, 2012) failed
to provide evidence on any alteration on LDL. However,
such studies may be difficult to compare as they were
conducted on another species of rodent and with different
methodological approaches (e.g. different fasting of the
animals and composition of the diet);
(c) although the systemic transmission of dsRNAs has
been demonstrated in plants, worms and insects, such
transport in mammals is still largely unknown (Melnyk
et al., 2011). In humans, the presence of endogenous
miRNAs has been documented in microvesicles
circulating in the bloodstream and their role in intercellular communication is currently under investigation
(Mittelbrunn & Sa´nchez-Madrid, 2012 and references
therein);
(d) the results presented by Zhang et al. (2012a) are not in
agreement with that documented in numerous clinical
trials involving oral delivery of small RNA molecules.
The stability of the dsRNAs in the GI tract and an
efficient absorption through the mucosa in order to
reach the active concentration of the molecule in the
bloodstream, are still the limiting factors in this therapeutic approach (Petrick et al., 2013 and references
therein);
(e) some miRNAs are active even at low concentrations
and plant miRNAs seem to differ structurally from mammalian miRNAs (Yu et al., 2005; Zhang et al. 2012a;
http://www.the-scientist.com/?articles.view/articleNo/
31975/title/Plant-RNA-Paper-Questioned/);
(f) interestingly, Zhang et al. (2012b) detected the MIR168a
sequence as predominant or sole plant miRNA in public
animal small RNA datasets including insects. The authors
point out that this may be an artifact due to the
sequencing methodology employed (i.e. cross-contamination of the multiplexed libraries).
It can be concluded, that the RNA in general has the same
‘‘history of safe use’’ as DNA, since it is a normal component
of the diet (Parrot et al., 2010). However, further investigations are necessary to clarify whether the evidence about the
MIR168a is due to its unique properties or such conclusions
can also be extended to other dsRNAs molecules contained in
food/feed.

Safety of the proteins encoded by the transgenes
The expression of the introduced gene(s) leads to biosynthesis
of one or more proteins. The ingestion of transgenic proteins
has posed some questions about their possible toxic or
allergenic effects in humans and animals. The safety of each
transgenic protein is evaluated by means of the following
analyses:
– bioinformatic analysis to assess the similarity with known
allergens, toxic proteins and bioactive peptides;
– functional stability to pH and temperature;
– in vitro digestibility using simulate mammalian gastric
fluid and simulated mammalian intestinal fluid, following the principle that a digested protein is less likely to be
allergenic and absorbed in a biologically active form;
– protein expression level and dietary uptake, to estimate
exposure of humans or animals to the protein;
– single dose (acute) toxicity testing and repeated dose
(sub-chronic) toxicity testing in rodents using the
purified transgenic protein, to predict in vivo possible
toxic outcome in humans (Delaney et al., 2008; EFSA,
2008).
The results of these analyses are usually part of the
documentation that GE crops developers submit to the
competent authorities during the approval phase (risk assessment) that precede the commercialization of a GE crop. These
data are not always made accessible by the companies or
the competent authorities or published on peer-reviewed
journals (Jaffe, 2004). However, as indicated by the significant increment of the publications after 2006, it seems that
the GE crop developers acknowledged the necessity of an
improved transparency (Domingo & Bordonaba, 2011). The
experimental data collected so far on authorized GE crops can
be summarized as follows:
(a) there is no scientific evidence of toxic or allergenic
effects;
(b) some concern has been raised against GE corn MON
810, MON863 and NK603 (de Vendoˆmois et al., 2009;
Se´ralini et al., 2007, 2012), but these experimental results
have been deemed of no significance (EFSA 2007, 2012;
Houllier, 2012; Parrot & Chassy, 2009);
(c) only two cases are known about the potential allergenicity of transgenic proteins, the verified case of the brazilnut storage protein in soybean, which has not been
marketed (Nordlee et al., 1996) and the not verified case
of maize Starlink (Siruguri et al., 2004);
(d) during the digestion process the proteins generally
undergo degradation that leads to the loss of activity
(Delaney et al., 2008);
(e) even though there are examples of some ingested proteins
that are absorbed in minute quantities in an essentially
intact form (e.g. ovalbumin, ovomucoid, b-lactoglobulin)
(Kier & Petrick, 2008) or proteins that are hydrolyzed
into smaller absorbed bioactive peptides (Udenigwe &
Aluko, 2012), the consumption of transgenic proteins
contained in the authorized GE crop does not result in
any detectable systemic uptake (Kier & Petrick, 2008)
and transgenic proteins are usually rapidly degraded and
not detectable in animal derived products (e.g. milk,
meat, eggs) (Ramessar et al., 2007);
(f) pre-screening of transgenic proteins through bioinformatic analyses contributes to avoid the introduction of
potentially toxic, allergenic or bioactive proteins into
food and feed crops (Delaney et al., 2008; Gibson, 2006;
Ladics et al., 2011);
(g) the application of the concept of ‘‘history of safe use’’
to the choice the transgene donor organisms may
increase intrinsic safety and simplify safety assessment
procedures.
Safety of the intended and unintended changes of crop
composition
Safety of the introduced change in the GE crop is usually
evaluated during the determination of compositional equivalence (Section ‘‘Substantial equivalence’’). However, on a
case-by-case basis, additional analyses can be requested, such
as that of processed foods or feeds, nutritional equivalence
and 90-day rodent feeding tests with whole GE food or feed
(EFSA, 2008, 2011).
A useful distinction can be introduced here between GE
crops modified for input traits (e.g. herbicide or insect
resistance) and GE crops with enhanced nutritional characteristics (e.g. increased vitamin content). For the former, the
experience suggests that, once the compositional equivalence
has been verified, little can be added by the other types
of analysis, and nutritional equivalence can be assumed
(EFSA, 2011).
On the contrary, for GE crops with improved nutritional
characteristics, the nutritional equivalence cannot be
assumed, and a nutritional animal feeding test using rapidly
growing animals (e.g. broilers) should be conducted to
demonstrate the intended nutritional effect. The high sensitivity of rapidly growing animals to toxic compounds may
also help to detect unintended effects. The 90-day rodent
feeding test is generally performed when the composition is
modified substantially or if there are indications of potential
unintended effects.
Only GE crops modified for agronomic traits have
been authorized for commercialization so far, with the only
exception of the ‘‘Amflora’’ potato (event EH92-527-1),
intended for industrial purpose but authorized also for feed
and nonintended consumption (http://ec.europa.eu/food/dyna/
gm_register/gm_register_auth.cfm?pr_id=39).
It is noteworthy that, at the moment, the route to the
authorization of GE crops intended only for industrial
purposes is not fully clarified by the legislation. However,
the results of animal tests are routinely presented to
the European safety assessment authorities, even if not
explicitly required (http://www.gmo-compass.org/eng/safety/
human_health/41.evaluation_safety_gm_food_major_underta
king.html).
Recently, Podevin & Jardin (2012) pointed out that the
viral promoter P35S, isolated from the cauliflower mosaic
virus (CaMV) and used in several GE crops to achieve strong
and constitutive expression of the transgene/s, partially
overlaps with the CaMV viral gene VI. In some long variants
of the P35S promoter this could potentially lead to the
production of a residual viral protein. The use of the short
version of the promoter is therefore recommended, even if the

bioinformatics analysis of the viral protein has not revealed
any relevant similarity with known allergens (Podevin &
Jardin, 2012).
An issue emerged about whether the combination of more
GE traits in a single crop (GE stacks) may introduce changes
that require additional safety assessment. Once safety of the
single traits has been established independently, their combination should be evaluated in terms of stability, expression
and possible interactions (EFSA, 2011). Weber et al. (2012)
pointed out that GE stacks do not impose any additional risks
in terms of transgene stability and expression, whereas
attention should be focused only on the possible interactions
between different traits.
Traceability
This is clearly a ‘‘hot topic’’ in GE food&feed (39.6%)
(Table 1), with the publication rate after 2005 being
high and constant (Figure 2). Traceability is defined in the
EU General Food Law Regulation 178/2002/EC, inspired
to the ISO standard, as the ‘‘ability to trace and follow
food, feed, food producing animals and other substances
intended to, or expected to, be incorporated into food or
feed, through all stages of production, processing and
distribution’’.
Traceability is a concept already widely applied to non-GE
food/feed and it is not connected with their safety (Davison &
Bertheau, 2007). It may include mandatory or voluntary
labeling for the foods or feeds that contain or consist of GE
crops or derived products. Labeling implies the definition of a
threshold value, above which the food/feed is labeled
according to the regulations in force.
The EU developed the most stringent regulatory framework for traceability of GE crops food/feed and derived
products in the world. They have adopted mandatory labeling
for unintentional presence of GE material in food or feed,
with the lowest threshold value (0.9% based on the number
of haploid genomes) compared to other countries (Davison &
Bertheau, 2007; Ramessar et al., 2008). Labeling requires the
detection and quantification of the GE food/feed or derived
product in the tested food/feed or seeds or any other product
when applicable. The scientific literature compiled about
traceability largely deals with the following issues:
(a) sampling procedures – there are no universally acknowledged sampling procedures (Davison & Bertheau, 2007);
this has been the object of a EU funded research
programme (Paoletti et al., 2006);
(b) detection method – a large consensus has been established on qPCR (real-time quantitative PCR) -based
methodologies that allows detection and quantification at
the same time. Other experimental strategies and analytical methods have been proposed (e.g. microarray,
Luminex XMAP), but they need further evaluation
(Querci et al., 2010);
(c) definition of reference systems – the measurement unit
of the GE product concentration depends on the unit used
for the certified reference material (CRM) chosen for
the analysis. At the moment, in the EU, mass fraction
percentages are used for the CRMs, whereas a later
recommendation from the EU suggested to use the ‘‘copy
number of transgenic DNA in relation to haploid
genomes’’, the unit of the legal threshold, so the
development of suitable CRMs is necessary (Trapmann
et al., 2009);
(d) detection of transgenes in mixtures composed by different ingredients, stacked transgenes and unauthorized
events: all these issues require specific approaches
and strategies have been proposed. The detection of the
unauthorized events is very complex, because it could
involve an already known transgene that did not
receive authorization or a totally unknown GE event.
Unfortunately, asynchronous authorization of GE crops
or derived products in different countries does not
improve this scenario: a higher degree of international
harmonization would be beneficial (Holst-Jensen
et al., 2012).
Conclusions
The technology to produce GE plants is celebrating its 30th
anniversary. It has brought about a dramatic increase in
scientific production over the years leading to high impact
findings either in basic research (such as RNAi-mediated
gene silencing) and applied research (GE crops), but the
adoption of GE plants in the agricultural system has raised
issues about environmental and food/feed safety.
We have reviewed the scientific literature on GE crop
safety for the last 10 years that catches the scientific
consensus matured since GE plants became widely cultivated
worldwide, and we can conclude that the scientific research
conducted so far has not detected any significant hazard
directly connected with the use of GM crops. The analysis of
the record list shows that the Biodiversity topic dominated,
followed by Traceability and GE food/feed consumption,
which contributed equally in terms of the number of records
(Table 1; Figure 3).
It is noteworthy that the number of papers on Traceability
has increased over the years, overcoming those on
Biodiversity in 2011, clearly indicating an increasing
demand for methods and protocols for transgene detection
(Figure 3). The Gene flow issue also received increasing
attention by the scientific community, as a response to the
demands of the consumers connected with the coexistence
of different productive systems (Figure 3).
It appears that knowledge on Gene flow and GE food/feed
consumption would have benefited from a higher number
of publications considering their high impact on both
environmental and food/feed risk assessment. The difficulties
of experimental design and, in the case of Gene flow, the
public opposition to field trials, may have discouraged
researchers, at least in the EU.
The literature about Biodiversity and the GE food/feed
consumption has sometimes resulted in animated debate
regarding the suitability of the experimental designs, the
choice of the statistical methods or the public accessibility
of data. Such debate, even if positive and part of the
natural process of review by the scientific community, has
frequently been distorted by the media and often used
politically and inappropriately in anti-GE crops campaigns.
In this regard, Houllier (2012) pointed out that, when

dealing with ‘‘hot issues’’, researchers should take special
care in following rigorous scientific standards, avoiding the
publication of data not sufficiently peer reviewed by the
scientific community.
It is interesting to note that the recent increase of scientific
publications about Traceability and Non-targeted assessment
(Figure 3) indicates considerable attention to the detection
systems and the search for new safety evidence about a
relatively low number of new approved GE crops. This
likely reflects the consolidation of a situation in which
the EU plays mainly the role of the importer of GE crop
products from other countries, and enforces a stringent
regulatory system.
In the EU, the regulatory burdens for GE crop approval are
extremely heavy (Kalaitzandonakes et al., 2007), de facto
excluding the public sector and minor crops from the
development of GE technology. As a result, the number of
experimental releases of GE crops is rapidly decreasing
(Lo¨chte, 2012) and even large companies are abandoning GE
(Dixelius et al., 2012; Laursen, 2012). This scenario is the
result of the interaction of complex sociological and psychological factors, risk/benefit ratios, political aspects and an
unbalanced scientific communication.
All these factors have to be considered globally and
taken into account in a constructive debate on whether the GE
crops represent a strategic resource for the future.
An improvement in the efficacy of the scientific communication to stakeholders, as clearly demonstrated in the case
of the recent case of GE wheat field trials in the UK
(Lo¨chte, 2012), could have a significant impact on the future
of agricultural GE.
We believe that genetic engineering and GE crops
should be considered important options in the efforts toward
sustainable agricultural production. Our collection of
scientific records is available to researchers, communicators
and teachers at all levels to help create an informed and
balanced public perception on the hot issue of GE use in
agriculture.
